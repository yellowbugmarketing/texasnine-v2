A veteran of the US Navy, he began his fitness journey helping fellow crew members on a ballistic missile submarine while underway during patrols. After his time in the service, it was a seamless transition to becoming a fitness professional and health advocate. His perspective about health and our body is that it is a gift and should not be taken for granted. He believes balance, functionality, mobility, and strength are paramount to any fitness regimen. So whatever your health and fitness goals, let Jake help you to create and execute a plan to achieve them"
